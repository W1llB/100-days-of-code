# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 24th September 2022

**Today's Progress**: Progressed through the [FCC Javascript Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-algorithm-scripting). Made it through 50% of the first Basic Javascript section.

**Thoughts:** All relatively straightforward so far. Some elements I have already encountered during attempts to learn Python. The logic side is satisfying to work through.
